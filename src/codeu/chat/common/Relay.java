// RELAY
//
// This is the interface for communicating with the relay. Communication with the relay
// is limited to two simple interfaces (writes and reads). As the relay is not expected
// to track conversations or users, each bundle sent to the relay and received from the
// the relay must be atomic and contain all information about the user, conversation, and
// message.
public interface Relay {

  // BUNDLE
  //
  // The relay's representation of what a message looks like. As the relay is not
  // going to track users and conversations so all information about a message must
  // be in the bundle. This means that each bundle will have a copy of the author's
  // id and name, a copy of the conversation's id and title. All information about
  // a message must be present for a server to recreate the series of events with
  // as little reasoning as possible.
  interface Bundle {

    // COMPONENT
    //
    // As there is a lot of similar information in a bundle. Component groups together
    // common fields to make the bundle interface easier to read. As a bundle is made-up
    // of three parts (user, conversation, and message) and each parts have a uuid,
    // string, and time field it cluttered the interface. A commonent is just a wrapper
    // to make the Bundle interface easier to read.

      // this is the creation time.

  //

  // must have information about the user and conversation that the message is

  // a message to the relay, a team must write their team id and team secret or

  //

  // the relay will return up to but may return less than the range. The range must
  // be positive. Negative ranges are not allowed and will return an empty

  // was given Uuids.NULL.
